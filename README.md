Testing and learning React

*README updated 9.3.2015*

**Steps taken:**
- Implementing CRUD functions in list
  - Actually quite easy task and creating very understandable structure
  - I would have liked to implement creating new items to separate component, but that would have meant that I would have to move state of data to upper container, which would have made things a bit more complicated, although reusability better
- Adding sortable function
  - I was using jQuery.sortable since there was no good plugin for React
  - Using jQuery wasn't really optimal since jQuery is using real DOM and React virtual, hopefully better solution will come

**Next steps:**
 - Familiarising myself to Flux architecture
 - Checking gulp, webpack, lodash and karma
 - Adding ajax-calls and testing some ideas in backend
